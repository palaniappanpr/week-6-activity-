Support vector machine (SVM) learns a hyperplane to classify data into 2 classes. At a high-level, SVM performs a similar task like C4.5 except SVM doesn't use decision trees at all. 	


K Algorithm is most popular for Cluster analysis technique for exploring dataset. Cluster analysis is a family of algorithms designed to form groups such that the group members are more similar versus non-group members. k-means creates $latex k$ groups from a set of objects so that the members of a group are more similar


C50 is advanced version of C4.5. C4.5 constructs a classifier in the form of a decision tree. To do this, C4.5 is given a set of data representing things that are already classified.


SVM accuracy:  97%
K Means accuracy:  88.6%
C50 accuracy: 95%
